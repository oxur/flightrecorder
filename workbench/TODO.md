# TODOs

## In Progress

* [ ] TBD

## Pending

* [ ] We need to allow users to generate a diagnosis report: prompt them for the issue they are experiening, use a template we have generated by AI for AI, filling in their issue, current system status and configuration, partial/complete data dumps, in preferred AI format, etc. maybe `fliterec diagnostic report`
* [ ] Decide upon export/dump format (see `crates/design/dev/0002-ai-diagnostic-data-export-guide.md`)
* [ ] We should add a `fliterec stream` or `fliterec tail` that updates the `fliterec` in daemon mode to write to stdout or stderr
* [ ] Add `launchctl` support (see dev doc 0001)
* could you write a report to workbench on the current project implementation status and what you intend to work
  on next? I think I will be working from another computer for the rest of the evening, so I will want to share
  that status as part of the context for a new Claude Code instance :-)

## Completed

* [x] TBD
